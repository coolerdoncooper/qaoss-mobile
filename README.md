Qaoss Mobile was motivated by a post-communist problem in central and eastern European countries. Everyone didn’t own a car during communism but after 1990 people were free to buy whatever they wanted and the number of cars on the road increased dramatically. Shortly after the turn of the century, car loans became available through the commercial banking system and the number of cars flooding the streets increased exponentially.

The old communist infrastructure, roads and parking space are grossly insufficient for the sheer number of competing cars on the road. People park their cars wherever they can find some daylight regardless where it might be, they have no choice. Double parked, on the sidewalk, blocking driveways, entry and exit gates etc.

As a courtesy to those they might be blocking, some people leave a slip of paper with their phone number on it under the windshield so they can be called to come move their car. But this is a very small number of people because most people don’t want to give out their phone number to just anybody walking by. Additional personal information can be found using just a phone number and people want to protect their privacy. Also phone numbers can be used for malicious and fraudulent purposes. This results in people honking their horns or yelling for the offending person to come move their car. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t but it always disturbs the rest of the neighborhood.

Qaoss allows drivers to place a QR code on their windshield so it can be scanned by someone needing to get in touch with the car owner. The caller never sees the car owner’s phone number and the car owner never sees the caller’s phone number. It’s a simple solution for a big problem.

Qaoss can be used in any similar situation. Someone left their child or dog in a hot car, someone left their lights on or their car alarm is going off and won’t stop. Car, boat, house, anything for sale.

Qaoss also solves the problem of notifying all your contacts if you change your number(s). Just change them in Qaoss and the next time a contact calls using Qaoss, the new numbers are used.
